            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <dateline>Moſcow, <date>
                     <hi>March</hi> 8. 1698/9. <hi>O.S.</hi>
                  </date>
               </dateline>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have deferr'd writing, till I could be able to give Your Lordſhip a true Account (from my own Knowledge) of the <hi>Czar</hi> (our Maſter's) Navy, which being a New Thing in the World as yet, I believe is variouſly talk'd of in <hi>England, &amp;c.</hi> Firſt, At <hi>Voronize</hi> there is already in the Water and Rigg'd, 36, and to be Launch'd in the Spring 20 more ſtout Ships, from 30 to 60 Guns. Next, 18 very large Gallies (built after the <hi>Venetian</hi> manner by <hi>Italian</hi> Maſters) are already compleated; and 100 ſmaller Gallies or Brigantines are equipt for the Sea; 7 Bomb-Ships are Launch'd and Rigg'd, and 4 Fireſhips are Building againſt the Spring, when they are all to go down to <hi>Azoph.</hi> The Ships are chiefly built by the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Danes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 25th of <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt his Majeſty came to <hi>Moſcow, incognito;</hi> immediately he took in hand the rewarding of General <hi>Gordon</hi>'s Soldiers, that fought againſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels he defeated in <hi>June</hi> laſt, and next day gave Orders to fetch up all thoſe of the Rebels who were diſperſed by way of Baniſhment, which were in all then left about 2700. I ſuppoſe Your Lordſhip has been inform'd by Publick News, how they are hung round the Walls of this City, ſome hundreds beheaded, ſome broke upon the Wheel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the whole Number of them, which was in all 3000.</p>
            <p>At my Arrival in <hi>Moſcow,</hi> I fell very ill of the Bloody-Flux, which made me be in <hi>Moſcow</hi> when his Majeſty came home: About the latter end of <hi>October</hi> I was ſomewhat recovered, his Majeſty then carried me down to <hi>Voronize</hi> with him. <hi>Voro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize</hi> is about 400 <hi>Engliſh</hi> Miles <hi>South-Eaſt</hi> from <hi>Moſcow.</hi> There the <hi>Czar</hi> immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet up a Ship of 60 Guns, where he is both Foreman and Maſter-Builder; and not to flatter him, I'le aſſure Your Lordſhip it will be the beſt Ship among them, and 'tis all from his own Draught: How he fram'd her together, and how he made the Mould, and in ſo ſhort a time as he did, is really wonderful: But he is able at this day to put his own Notions into Practice, and laugh at his <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Builders for their Ignorance. There are ſeveral Pieces of Workmanſhip, as in the Keel, Stem, and Poſt, which are all purely his own Invention, and ſound good Work, and would be approved of by all the Shipwrights of <hi>England,</hi> if they ſaw it. She has a round Tuck, and a narrow Floor, a good tumbling Home, and Circular Side; none are to exceed 11 <hi>Dutch</hi> Foot Draught of Water. He has not run into any Extreme, But taken the Mediums of all good Sailing Properties, which ſeem beſt. One may, methinks, call her an Abſtract of his own private Obſervations whilſt Abroad, ſtrengthned by Your Lordſhip's Improving Diſcourſes to him on that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and his own extraordinary Notion of Sailing. One thing as to her Keel is, That ſhould it wholly be beat out, yet it is ſo ordered, that the Ship will be tight and ſafe, and may continue ſo at Sea afterwards.</p>
            <p>I likewiſe made a Suit of Moulds for a Ship of Sixty Guns, but after ſome time fell ſick again; and at <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> when his Majeſty came to <hi>Moſcow,</hi> he brought me back again for Recovery of my Health, where I am at preſent; notwithſtanding, both our
<pb facs="tcp:136174:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>Ships go forward, having put things in ſuch a poſture, as that a <hi>Grecian</hi> (who has been in <hi>England</hi>) carries on the Buſineſs. Mr. <hi>Ney</hi> is Building of a 60 Gun Ship there too; beſides, there are four of that Size (near built) upon the <hi>Done,</hi> two of 40 Guns already at <hi>Azoph,</hi> carried down ſome time ſince, and a great many Galleys, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Rivers <hi>Vorona,</hi> at <hi>Voronitz,</hi> when I was there, was hardly ſo broad as the Ships are long; but in the Spring about the latter End of <hi>April,</hi> or beginning of <hi>May,</hi> when the Snow melts, there is 16 Foot Water in that little River, and continues this height about 12 or 14 days, with a Rapid Torrent, with that force, that though it be 1000 Miles down to <hi>Azoph,</hi> yet the Ships will eaſily be there in 9 or 10 days. There is 30000 Soldiers at <hi>Voronize,</hi> to defend the Ships from the <hi>Tartars,</hi> who are very miſchievous, and very ſwift in ſetting a place on Fire, and running away again. Thoſe Ships that are Launcht lie faſt in Ice about two Foot thick, ſo that the River is now as firm as Land, although this is reckoned a very mild Winter; for I remember in <hi>January</hi> one Afternoon with a <hi>Southerly</hi> Wind it thaw'd and rain'd for 3 or 4 hours, which is rare enough for an Almanack. The Ground is covered with Snow about a Yard deep, and 'tis mighty clear, piercing cold Weather, ſuch as in <hi>England</hi> we can't imagine.</p>
            <p>Looking againſt the Sun, one may ſee innumerable Atoms of congeal'd Snow, flying up and down the Sky like Duſt; but within Doors the Rooms are about as warm as 'tis in <hi>June</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> made ſo by Stoves, all over of a ſoft familiar heat. As to the Temper of the Climate in general, the Summers (as laſt was) are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive hot, the Winter as cold; the latter end of <hi>April,</hi> and part of <hi>May,</hi> the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is almoſt drown'd by exceſſive overflowings of the Rivers, occaſioned by the melted Snow. The Land in Summer is pleaſant all over, and fertil, and all provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions wonderful cheap; as, a good fat Sheep for four Shillings, Bread, Beer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably; and even now in Winter 'tis not much dearer. I hope by this time Twelve-Months, to give Your Lordſhip (in <hi>England</hi>) a particular Deſcription of the Country by word of Mouth. His Majeſty was at my Chamber two days of laſt Week, with Mr. <hi>Styles</hi> as Interpreter (who gives his humble duty to Your Lordſhip) You may gueſs what His Majeſty came to be inform'd in whilſt he was there; I ſhew'd him a Model of a Machine to bring up the <hi>Royal Tranſport</hi> to the <hi>Volga,</hi> at 17 Inches Draught of Water; he was pleas'd to like it, but gave no Orders for put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it in Execution, ſo I believe ſhe will lie where ſhe is now, and periſh. Here are Three Envoys, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Emperor's,</hi> the <hi>Danes,</hi> and <hi>Brandenburgs,</hi> in this <hi>Slabado,</hi> (as it is call'd,) which lies from <hi>Moſcow,</hi> as <hi>Lambeth</hi> does from <hi>London.</hi> The whole place is Inhabited by the <hi>Dutch;</hi> I believe there may be 400 Families. Laſt <hi>Sunday</hi> and <hi>Monday</hi> the Strangers were invited to the Conſecration of General <hi>La Fort</hi>'s New Houſe, which is the nobleſt Building in <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> and finely furniſht. There were all the Envoys, and as near as I could gueſs 200 Gentlemen, <hi>Engliſh, French,</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> and about as many Ladies; each Day were Dancing and Muſick. All the Envoys, and all the Lords (but three in <hi>Moſcow</hi>) are going to <hi>Voronize</hi> to ſee the Fleet, I ſuppoſe. His Majeſty went laſt <hi>Sunday</hi> to <hi>Voronize</hi> with Prince <hi>Alexander,</hi> and I am to go down (being ſomething recovered) with the Vice-Admiral about ſix days hence. This day was a Muſter of all the Seamen and Officers in his Majeſty's Service, ¾ of which are diſcharg'd: They are to go home by the way of <hi>Narve.</hi> Capt. <hi>Perry,</hi> who was ſent to make a Communication between the Rivers <hi>Volga</hi> and <hi>Done,</hi> near <hi>Aſtracan,</hi> is returned from Surveying the ſame; he makes it appear Feaſible enough to be done; accordingly his Majeſty has ordered 40000 Men to be rais'd, and Materials provided for doing the ſame; which he has promis'd to finiſh in Five years, tho' I believe it may be done in leſs. When that is perform'd, then the <hi>Czar</hi> may carry his Ships from the <hi>Black Sea</hi> into the <hi>Caſpian Sea,</hi> and extend his Conqueſt that way.</p>
